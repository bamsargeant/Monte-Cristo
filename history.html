                    <h6 class="p1">History of Monte Cristo</h6>
                    The original owner, Christopher William Crawley
                    [b1841-1910], acquired two parcels of land in Junee on
                    conditional purchase, one of 400 acres, another 120 acres in
                    January 1876 under provisions of the Robertson Act of 1861 .
                    After years of struggle, farming and the many privations of
                    regional life in a primitive slab hut, his fortunes changed
                    when the Great Southern Railway Line opened in 1878. Perhaps
                    tipped off the year before, he acquired a license and built
                    the Railway Hotel opposite the soon to be bustling railway
                    station. At that time the village consisted of Mr. Crawley's
                    hotel, the adjoining Railway Store run by George Dobbyns,
                    and a few scattered slab houses and bark huts. The township
                    benefited tremendously from the influx of travelers and
                    agricultural trade, fueling the regions explosive growth. </div>

                      <h6 class="p1">Symbol Of A Founder</h6>
                      Crawleys wealth increased dramatically, as did his
                      holdings, acquiring almost the entire area of present day
                      Junee at his peak. Mr Crawley soon became a force to be
                      reckoned with, more than a pillar of society, he became a
                      town founder. His natural generosity and sense of civic
                      responsibility resulted in him being held in high regard
                      by all segments of the community. As a devout Roman
                      Catholic, he donated a parcel of land to the church and
                      helped finance the construction of St Joseph's Church and
                      other important civic projects, at a time when government
                      funding wasn't really available. His hard earned wealth
                      and new found social status needed an omnipresent symbol,
                      so Monte Cristo (literally Mount of Christ) came into
                      being.</div>

                      <h6 class="p1">Additions and Expansion</h6>
                      Prior to the construction of the new house in 1884/85 the
                      Crawley's lived in a small brick cottage now called the
                      Original Homestead. It was built in 1876 and became the
                      kitchen and servants quarters. Which itself was part of a
                      trend as their original onsite home, a slab hut, had
                      become servants quarters when finances improved and a
                      grander brick replacement was constructed. The slab hut
                      made way for stables to house Mr Crawley's prized race
                      horses, which coincided with the construction of the dairy
                      and preceded a wood ballroom which stood directly behind
                      the Old Homestead and was connected to a carbide gas
                      supply illuminating the main house in 1902. </div>

                    <h6 class="p1">Home Is A Castle </h6>
                    Envisioned as the grandest home of the regions' landed
                    gentry, Monte Cristo succeeded in becoming the ultimate
                    status symbol. Like a castle in feudal Europe it was the
                    center of local power and sat perched high on a hill so its
                    lord could survey his realm from the second floor balcony.
                    However it was still a farming property, the nucleus of
                    Crawley family agricultural pursuits, and Mr Crawley wasn't
                    above getting his hands dirty. No price was spared in its
                    construction, built of sandstock bricks fired on site and
                    laid on a drystone foundation, in over a century not a
                    single crack has appeared. Downstairs walls are 18" thick,
                    the upper 9" and both made of solid brick, the ceilings are
                    12 feet high, upstairs constructed of cypress pine, milled
                    locally, and downstairs lath and plaster. The interior plan
                    of the house is simple with rooms opening off a central
                    hallway which runs through the house and contains a
                    staircase. </div>

                    <h6 class="p1">Living the Good Life</h6>
                    A late Victorian house of pleasing line and proportion, it
                    retains much of the symmetry of an earlier period, with only
                    the applied decoration of plaster work and cast iron lattice
                    adding the necessary touch of opulence so loved by the
                    Victorians. Its charm was in the balance of design and in
                    this, it demonstrates a style of building unchanged since
                    early Colonial days.<br>
                    The homestead was renowned as one of the regions' social
                    centers, a place where balls were held and local gentry
                    idled away the day in country pursuits, playing tennis and
                    golf on the regions first course. In between these pleasant
                    activities the Crawleys raised seven children, all of whom
                    went on to live happy, productive lives: Helen Ann (Lillian)
                    - Lydia Blanch - Florence Agnes - Angela Christina (Pidge)
                    and their brothers Mervyn Marmaduke - Aubrey Clarence and
                    Alphonse Hilary. All of them were musically talented.</div>

                    <h6 class="p1">Only The Best Schooling </h6>
                    As a result of the Crawley's new wealth, the children were
                    sent away to be educated at the best schools they could
                    afford, with the girls at the Dominican Convent in Maintland
                    and St Vincent's Potts Point. All were taught music and
                    painting. Lillian (Mrs. Lawliss) was the great beauty of the
                    family with striking violet eyes, she was an accomplished
                    pianist and composer. She composed the "Scotia Schottische"
                    in 1895 for a ball at Government House and dedicated it to
                    Lady Dunbar. She also taught at the first Junee School known
                    as the Railway Station School. The girls were extremely
                    careful of their English rose complexions and never ventured
                    out in the sun without being completely covered, and
                    carrying a green-lined parasol for added protection.<br>
                    Angela Christina was a talented artist and enjoyed sketching
                    and would do pen drawings on envelopes containing letters to
                    friends, samples of which still exist. </div>

                    Mrs Crawley is remembered as being very like Queen Victoria,
                    and usually wore a black lace dress, lace cap with a
                    stand-up beaded collar and lace cap. She ruled the house
                    with a rod of iron and with her husband appeared to be the
                    quintessential Victorian couple, but as was often the case,
                    perceptions were misleading. Staff would later recount
                    stories of harsh mistreatment by their employers, which
                    spawned many ominous legends persisting today. William
                    Christopher Crawley died at Monte Cristo on 14th December
                    1910 at the age of 69 from heart failure, secondary to blood
                    poisoning caused by a carbuncle on his neck becoming
                    infected from rubbing up against a starched collar.</div>

                    It is believed his widow only left the house on two
                    occasions in the remaining 23 years of her life, turning an
                    upstairs Box (storage) Room into a chapel, she immersed
                    herself in the Bible. Mrs Crawley herself died at Monte
                    Cristo on 12th August 1933 at the age of 92 of heart
                    failure, secondary to a ruptured appendix. The homesteads'
                    glory days were now over, but Monte Cristo would remain a
                    Crawley family home until 1948 when the last members of the
                    family vacated, after which no one would live there again
                    until it was acquired by the author more then a decade
                    later. By which time its furnishings had been auctioned off
                    and stately grandeur faded by time, vandalism and neglect of
                    a generation which had ceased to care about its pioneering
                    past.</div>
